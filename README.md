# Netflix-watch-list
This program can store and manipulate the titles of shows you want to watch. You can add, view, mark, remove, sort, and print your shows in the list. This is helpful
for those who want to keep track of their shows. I mainly used https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp to help me navigate this assignment.


The program will display a menu with the following options: 
1. Add a task to the watch list 
2. View the current watch list 
3. Mark a show as completed 
4. Remove a show from the watch list
5. Remove all shows from the watch list
6. Sort the show titles alphabetically
7. Print the number of shows on the watch list
8. Exit the program

Input the number of your desired action and it will run!
